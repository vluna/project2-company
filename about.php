		<h2>Producer</h2>
		<p>We can't produce great meat products without great partners. We will only purchase from producers who are accredited under the Canadian Quality Assurance (CQA) program for hogs and cattle, the on-farm food safety program for Canadian hog and cattle producers.</p>

		<p>Producers must not only commit to raise hogs and cattle that meet our quality standards, but they must also agree to adhere to our hog production and animal welfare policies. We have established strict feeding guidelines that all our producers must follow - not only does this make for healthier pigs and cattle, it makes for great tasting pork and beef!</p>

		<p>Our proprietary "trace back" system gives all of our producers online access to extensive reports that assess the quality of their hogs and cattle. This program is the backbone of our progressive improvement initiative, and it gives us the ability to guarantee that our pork and beef products are not only great tasting, but were produced with a ‘farm to fork’ commitment to quality.</p>
