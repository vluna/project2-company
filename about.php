		<h3>Producer</h3>
		<p>We can't produce great meat products without great partners. We will only purchase from producers who are accredited under the Canadian Quality Assurance (CQA) program for hogs and cattle, the on-farm food safety program for Canadian hog and cattle producers.</p>

		<p>Producers must not only commit to raise hogs and cattle that meet our quality standards, but they must also agree to adhere to our hog production and animal welfare policies. We have established strict feeding guidelines that all our producers must follow - not only does this make for healthier pigs and cattle, it makes for great tasting pork and beef!</p>

		<p>Our proprietary "trace back" system gives all of our producers online access to extensive reports that assess the quality of their hogs and cattle. This program is the backbone of our progressive improvement initiative, and it gives us the ability to guarantee that our pork and beef products are not only great tasting, but were produced with a ‘farm to fork’ commitment to quality.</p>

		<h3>Pork Attributes</h3>
		<p>Our pigs are vegetable grain fed. No animal bone meal is fed to our pigs. Ever. Our pigs happily nosh on barley, peas, wheat, soy, minerals, and vitamins.</p>
		<p>Barley is one of the main components of our feed rations. This results in fat that is whiter and firmer than what other producers, who use corn as the staple of their pigs’ diet, can offer. The result is a product with a richer texture and taste.</p>
		<p>Our pigs are raised without the use of Dried Distillers Grains with Solubles (DDGS). DDGS is a cheaper feed additive prevalent in the meat industry. Sakura Farms producers only raise their pigs with premium feeds and without the use of byproducts such as DDGS (a byproduct of ethanol production).</p>
		<p>Our pigs are also raised without the use of Ractopamine, a beta antagonist drug commonly used as an artificial feed additive to promote leanness in pigs and cattle. We grow our pigs in the traditional way. Period.</p>
		<p>Our producers use antibiotics for therapeutic use only under the strict requirements of the Canadian Quality Assurance (CQA). They also use a long withdrawal period that goes above and beyond the guidelines set by Health Canada. This ensures that are no regulatory traces of antibiotics found in any of our products.</p>
		<p>At Sakura Farms, we make absolutely no compromises when it comes to the care and diet of our hogs. We believe that healthy pigs make for tasty and nutritious pork!</p>
