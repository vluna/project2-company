				<p>Pork side ribs are very flavorful and when cooked properly, their tenderness and juiciness can’t be beat. This versatile cut can be cooked various ways – grilled, barbecued, smoked or oven baked.</p>

				<p>Pork side ribs are less meaty and less expensive than back ribs. The cut doesn't include the upper rib area (e.g. the parts of the rib that are up in the back of the pig), but rather the sides and down into the belly. </p>

				<p>They have the skirt meat and leaf lard trimmed off them. When cut for Chinese Sweet and Sour style ribs, they are cut into strips 1 inch (2.5 cm) wide. They have a good amount of fat, so they can practically baste themselves. They are an ideal candidate for rubs instead of sauces, if you wish.</p>
